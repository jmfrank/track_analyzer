This contains Matlab functions for calculation of
distance transform of binary 3D images, bwdistsc 
and bwdistsc1. bwdistsc1 accepts additional parameter
to restrict the calculation of the distance transform 
only to a smaller band around the object, out to some 
distance maxval. This may significantly accelerate 
calculations in strongly non-convex situations, where 
the distance transform is needed only out to a certain 
smaller value. 
 
If you find any bugs or errors in the package, please 
report them to the author at the email address listed 
with Matlab Exchange.
