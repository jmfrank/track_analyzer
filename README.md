# track_analyzer
Matlab class for segmentation of image data (2D,3D, cells, particles, etc). 

This was designed to analyze experiments from my PhD work on YAP distribution dynamics and nascent transcription dynamics (paper coming soon...). However, this class has more general purpose uses for tracking cells and even particles associated with cells, which is important for analyzing nascent transcription experiments. 

Segmentation functions (segment_2D, segment_3D, segment_3D_gpu) have many parameters and possible steps used for segmenting miscroscopy images. Examples will be provided to make sense of all options and parameters.
